# Lists

Prepare list of names. Every element of this list is the name of the text file. Then prepare another list in which you will put in the i-th position the contents of the text file 
with the name stored in the i-th position of first list. Then change each item in the second list such that each word begin with a capital letter and then containe only small letters. 
We leave characters other than letters unchanged. And then overwrite the contents of the files with the strings modified in this way from the second list.
