# Lists

Write a program with a list of dates in a file. Take care of validating the date the app gets from file. It should be in the 2011-02-04 example format. 
Prepare two lists based on the dates list you downloaded. First list is a list of dates that succeeded convert from the list in file. The second list is the list
of strings that contain strings that represent an invalid date. An example of such a date is 2011-02-31. Find the latest dates from the list of correctly converted dates,
the earliest one and the difference between them in days, hours and seconds.
