# ISBN Verifier

The [ISBN-10 verification process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Standard_Book_Number) is used to validate book identification
numbers. These normally contain dashes and look like: `3-598-21508-8`

Given a string the program should check if the provided string is a valid ISBN-10.
The program should be able to verify ISBN-10 both with and without separating dashes.
